# Better Talk

Welcome to Better Talk, an innovative project for the WWDC24 Swift Student Challenge that aims to revolutionize the way we enhance our communication skills. 
## Overview

Better Talk leverages the power of SwiftUI for crafting an intuitive user interface, combined with the advanced capabilities of Apple's **Speech** framework to offer a unique approach in improving public speaking and communication skills. This project is designed to assist users in practicing and refining their ability to speak clearly, confidently, and effectively in various contexts.
